#### Sizing

```
-s, --size <size>             Size to execute.
    --size-currency <source>  Source currency for calculating size [default: base].
    --size-hook <hook>        Source size for calculating relative size [default: default].
```

[Learn more about order sizing](./order-sizing.md).

---

#### Pricing

```
-p, --price <price>      Price that orders executed at limit will be placed at.
    --price-hook <hook>  Source price for calculating relative price [default: market].
```

[Learn more about order pricing](./order-pricing.md).

---

#### Trigger price

```
--trigger-price <price>  Price that triggers stop or take profit orders.
```

Examples: `0.001`, `10`, `100k`.

---

#### Trail value

```
--trail-value <value>  Distance that price must change direction and move in order to trigger trailing stop orders.
```

Positive value for `buy` orders (i.e. the price must increase by the value without making a new low); negative value for `sell` orders (i.e. the price must decrease by the value without making a new high).

Examples: `1`, `-1`, `1k`.

---

#### Split

```
--split <count>  Splits the order into a number of smaller, equal-sized individual orders.
```

Split orders can be used to disguise the total order size.

Compatible with all order types.

Examples: `1`, `100`, `1k`.

---

#### Duration

```
--duration <duration>  Spreads the placement of a split order's individual orders linearly (i.e. fixed interval) over a total duration.
```

Timed orders can be combined with market orders to create TWAP orders: these can be used to minimise market impact. Timed orders can also be combined with limit orders to delay individual order placement: these can be used to show smaller parts of an order in the orderbook at once.

Compatible with all split orders.

Examples: `30s`, `1h45m10s`, `3h`.

---

#### Reduce-Only

```
--reduce-only     Enable Reduce-Only mode. Orders will only reduce your position.
--no-reduce-only  Disable Reduce-Only mode.
```

Compatible with all order types.

---

#### Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC)

```
--ioc     Enable IOC mode. Limit orders will only be executed as the taker.
--no-ioc  Disable IOC mode.
```

Compatible order types: `limit`.

---

#### Post-Only

```
--post-only     Enable Post-Only mode. Limit orders will only be executed as the maker.
--no-post-only  Disable Post-Only mode.
```

Compatible order types: `limit`.

---

#### Retry-Until-Filled

```
--retry     Enable Retry-Until-Filled mode. Triggered orders that are executed at market will be retried until the order size is filled.
--no-retry  Disable Retry-Until-Filled mode.
```

Compatible order types: `stop-market`, `trailing-stop`, `take-profit-market`.

---

#### Rate limit

```
--rate-limit <rate limit>  Advanced users only. Order placement rate limit, denoted as request limit per interval (milliseconds).
```

`6/200` means 'send a maximum of `6` order placement requests every `200` milliseconds'.

Examples: `2/200`, `6/200`, `24/200`.

[Learn more about rate limit overrides](./rate-limit-overrides.md).

---

### Examples

Please see [here](./examples.md).

### Notes

Complex orders can have some individual orders rejected. Individual orders that fail to be placed due to rate limits or unexpected errors will automatically be retried. Individual orders that fail to be placed due to other reasons (e.g. connection loss, not enough margin) will be ignored and execution will continue. This may result in incomplete orders.

The order placement sequence of complex orders is not guaranteed: individual orders are often sent in parallel, to increase speed, and it is impossible to predict which will be accepted first by the FTX platform.

FTX trading fees are charged per volume executed, and not per trade executed, so multiple smaller orders will incur the same total fee as if they were placed as a single large order.
