# Study: auto-compounding

| Annual interest rate | Effective annual interest rate with hourly compounding\* |
| -------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------: |
|                   5% |                                                   ~5.13% |
|                  10% |                                                  ~10.52% |
|                  25% |                                                  ~28.40% |
|                  50% |                                                  ~64.87% |

**\*Formula:** (1 + X / 8760)<sup>8760</sup> - 1\
_X = Average annual lending rate_

## Conclusion

The reward from compounding earned interest, and hence the value of setting up auto-compounding, increases as interest rate(s), size(s) lent, and duration(s) lent increase.
