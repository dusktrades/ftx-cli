## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14.13.0+ ([why?](#why-do-i-need-nodejs-v14130))

It is recommended that you use a version manager to install and update Node.js, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Unix-like, macOS, WSL, etc.) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Windows).

You can find other ways to install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org).

![Divider](docs/images/divider.png)

## Installation

### Try it out

Not sure whether you want to install yet? You can execute commands remotely from the npm registry with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx), which is included with Node.js.

Here's one that will display previous and current FTX lending rates for USD and USDT:

```sh
npx ftx-cli rates --currency usd,usdt
```

### Global package

The quickest and recommended way to install is from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftx-cli), which is included with Node.js. By default, the latest version will be installed and you will be notified when an update is available.

```sh
npm install -g ftx-cli
```

### Alternative methods

Advanced users may want to try one of the [alternative installation methods](./docs/guides/alternative-installation-methods.md).

![Divider](docs/images/divider.png)

## Getting started

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Planning on using FTX CLI purely for displaying exchange data? You can ignore this section for now; API credentials (key and secret) are only required for authenticated, account-related parts of the platform, such as trading and lending.

### Create API credentials

1. If you don't have an FTX account yet, [create one](https://ftx.com/#a=dusktrades) ([click here](https://ftx.us/#a=dusktrades) for FTX US)
2. Select 'Main Account' (account-wide) or the specific subaccount that FTX CLI can access:
   - [Subaccounts](https://ftx.com/subaccounts#a=dusktrades) ‚Üí 'CREATE SUBACCOUNT' or 'Select Account'
3. If you want to margin trade or lend, make sure to enable [spot margin trading](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053007671):
   - [Settings](https://ftx.com/profile#a=dusktrades) ‚Üí Margin ‚Üí 'ENABLE SPOT MARGIN TRADING'
4. Create your API key and secret:
   - [Settings](https://ftx.com/profile#a=dusktrades) ‚Üí Api ‚Üí 'CREATE API KEY'

### Save API credentials

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your machine is shared or unsecure, it is recommended that you save your API credentials elsewhere instead of using the [`login`](./docs/topics/accounts/README.md#login) command.
>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è API credentials and subaccount names are case-sensitive, as they are used to authenticate with the FTX platform. API credentials can be copy and pasted after you create them, and subaccount names from the [subaccounts page](https://ftx.com/subaccounts#a=dusktrades).

```sh
# Account-wide access (requires API credentials not linked to a specific subaccount).
ftx login --key YOUR_API_KEY --secret YOUR_API_SECRET

# Subaccount-only access.
ftx login --key YOUR_API_KEY --secret YOUR_API_SECRET --subaccount YOUR_SUBACCOUNT
```

### Secure API credentials

Here are some best practices for keeping your API credentials secure:

1. Edit API key permissions to the minimum required for FTX CLI to function properly:
   - Disable 'Read-only'
   - Disable 'Withdrawals enabled'
   - Disable 'Internal transfers enabled'
2. If you know the static IP address(es) you will be using, you can further improve security by whitelisting them:
   - 'WHITELIST IP'

## Usage

### Global options

You can include these options with any command to modify its behaviour.

```
General:
  -v, --version                  Output the version number.
  -h, --help                     Display help for command.

Platform:
  -e, --exchange <exchange>      FTX exchange platform.

Account:
  -k, --key <key>                FTX API key.
  -x, --secret <secret>          FTX API secret.
  -a, --subaccount <subaccount>  FTX subaccount name.

Behaviour:
  --schedule <schedule>          Schedule command to run at a future date and time or periodically, according to a given interval, until manually aborted.

UI:
  --[no-]colour                  Toggle coloured output.
  --[no-]update-notifications    Toggle update notifications. When enabled and an update is available, a notification will appear after command execution at most once a day.
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Inline options take priority over saved credentials (via [`login`](./docs/topics/accounts/README.md#login)) and configuration (via [`config`](./docs/topics/configuration/README.md#config)), meaning you can set your defaults and then override them on a per-command basis where necessary.

## FAQ

### Why do I need Node.js v14.13.0+?

FTX CLI runs on Node.js ‚Äì which is constantly evolving ‚Äì and v14.13.0 just happens to have a slick, modern feature set that we like (notably: [named imports from CommonJS modules](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35249)) while being LTS, and without the need to transpile or use experimental flags. We could certainly increase backwards compatibility by forgoing some of these built-in features, but we would still have to draw the line somewhere: so why not here? Please let us know about your use case if this is an issue.

### How are my API credentials used?

[See for yourself](https://github.com/dusktrades/ftx-cli/search?q=secret)! TL;DR: FTX CLI only communicates with FTX or FTX US, and your API credentials will be stored on your machine if you decide to [`login`](./docs/topics/accounts/README.md#login).

### Why did I get rate-limited?

It is possible to hit the [rate limits set out by FTX](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052595091-Ratelimits-on-FTX) if you attempt to execute large amounts of commands in a short period of time. Slow down!

### Why did I receive _'Size too large'_ error?

The FTX API seems to accept sizes with precision up to 8 decimal places, which you can utilise if you set size explicitly.

However, we have encountered strange behaviour when creating lending offers close to your lendable size (such as when auto-compounding), therefore we truncate lendable size to 6 decimal places before communicating with FTX. This makes the errors less common, but it remains possible to receive them while we look for a more robust solution. As a workaround, you can try the command again or wait for the next repeat scheduled run.

### Why would I want to auto-compound my lending offers?

Auto-compounding is perfect if you want to maximise lending earnings while avoiding manually updating your lending offers to include recent payouts. It is worth the small effort to set up if you intend to lend long-term with decent size. See the table below for examples:

| Average annual lending rate | Effective annual rate (with hourly compounding)\* |
| --------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: |
|                          5% |                                            ~5.13% |
|                         10% |                                           ~10.52% |
|                         25% |                                           ~28.40% |
|                         50% |                                           ~64.87% |

**\*Formula:** (1 + X / 8760)<sup>8760</sup> - 1\
_X = Average annual lending rate_

### What's the screenshot setup?
